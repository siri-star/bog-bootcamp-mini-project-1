                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roses_are_rosie/">Rosé</a> (full name: Roseanne Park) is the main vocalist of BLACKPINK.
                    She was born on February 11, 1997 in Australia.
                    Her <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5BQcoDfcZ8aBcikYX9B7Ob">solo album "R"</a> has 2 tracks, both of which she helped write.
                    Her unique tambre makes BLACKPINK's songs unbelievably addicting - check out some of my favorite covers of hers below!<br> <br>
                    Fun fact: Prior to debuting with BLACKPINK, she collaborated with G-Dragon on his 2012 track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfFdaKtudT4">"Without You"</a>, which peaked at #10 on the Gaon Music Chart.
